# Pedestrian-Detection
Real Time Pedestrain Detection Using Haar Cascades (with OPEN CV)

##About The Project

This project is a real-time pedestrian detection system developed using Python and OpenCV. 
It detects humans in video streams or webcam feeds and highlights them with bounding boxes. 
The system is designed for applications like traffic monitoring, pedestrian safety analysis, 
and surveillance systems, providing a simple yet effective tool for real-world object detection. 
It leverages pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers for fast and accurate detection.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
Detects pedestrians in real-time using webcam or video.
- Uses Haar Cascade Classifier (pre-trained model from OpenCV).
- Highlights pedestrians with bounding boxes.
- Simple and lightweight Python implementation.
